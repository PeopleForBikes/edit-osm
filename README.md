Tools for editing OSM files for BNA scenario planning

The BNA can be used as a scenario planning tool by running the analysis on proposed/hypothetical infrastructure and comparing the results to BNA scores for the existing/actual network. Generating data for hypothetical infrastructure requires modifying OpenStreetMap data and saving the modified file without uploading the modifications back to OpenStreetMap. JOSM is the easiest tool to make modifications, providing a GUI and the ability to make edits to OSM data offline. Instructions for modifying OSM data to run the BNA for scenario planning follow. 


## How to Create Hypothetical OSM Data for the BNA
1. Download OSM data for target area
2. Modify OSM data to include proposed infrastructure
3. If new features were added to OSM, run the data through the number.py script.

IT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NOT TO UPLOAD THE HYPOTHETICAL DATA BACK TO OPENSTREETMAP, AS THIS WILL PRODUCE INACCURACIES IN OSM.
